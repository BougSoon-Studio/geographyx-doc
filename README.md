# Introduction

## What is GeographyX

GeographyX is a JavaScript API that enables you to retrieve detailed information about countries, access a complete list of world countries, retrieve country data based on information and obtain weather information for a country.

### Integration

To use our api, you must import the geographyx.js file via a script tag, example:

```js
     <script type="module">
         import {
             Auth,
             getCountryInfo,
             fetchCountryData,
             getAllCountries,
             whatCountry,
             weatherCountry
         } from "https://blonality-studio.000.pe/geographyx/v2/geographyx.js";

        // rest of your script

      </script>
```
